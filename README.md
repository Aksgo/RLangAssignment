# Data Analysis and Visualization with R Welcome to the Data Analysis and Visualization with R project. In this project, you will work on various tasks related to R programming, data analysis, and visualization. To get started, please follow the instructions below. 

## Getting Started 

### **1\. Install Required Packages**
 Before you begin, ensure that you have the necessary R packages installed. To do this, run the `install_packages.R` script provided in the repository:
```Rscript install_packages.R```

This script will install the required packages locally.

### **2\. Fork and Clone the Repository**

First, fork this repository to your GitHub account. Then, clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git```

```cd your-forked-repo```

### **3\. Complete the Tasks**

Inside the repository, you'll find three folders: **tasks/basics.R**, **tasks/loops.R**, and **tasks/dataset.R**. Each folder contains R script files with tasks for you to complete. Start with **basics.R** and proceed to **loops.R**, and finally **dataset.R**.

Each task is worth a certain number of points. The tasks in **basics.R** and **loops.R** together are worth 50 points, while the **dataset.R** task is also worth 50 points. You can check your progress and score by running **main.R**.

### **4\. Task Completion**

To complete a task:

*   Open the relevant R script (e.g., **tasks/basics.R**) and follow the instructions.
*   Write meaningful comments and code to solve each task.
*   Save your script.

### **5\. Run main.R**

After completing the tasks in **basics.R** and **loops.R**, you can use **main.R** to check if your solutions are correct. Run the following command in your R environment:

```RScript main.R``` or ```source("main.R")```

This will evaluate the tasks in **basics.R** and **loops.R** and display your score in the terminal.

### **6\. Create a Pull Request**

Once you have completed all the tasks, including the **dataset.R** task, create a pull request (PR) to the original repository. Make sure to include:

*   Screenshots of any plots or charts you generated.
*   A description of the changes you made.
*   The score shown in the terminal after running **main.R**.

Your PR will be reviewed and evaluated for the **dataset.R** task.

## **Repository Structure**

*   **install\_packages.R**: Installs required R packages.
*   **tasks/basics.R**: Basic R programming tasks worth 50 points.
*   **tasks/loops.R**: Loop-related R tasks worth 50 points.
*   **tasks/dataset.R**: Data analysis and visualization task (reviewed by the owner).

## **Good luck with the tasks, and happy coding!**
