# Task 1: Calculate the Sum of Even Numbers
# - Define a function called 'sum_even_numbers' that takes a positive integer 'n' as input.
# - Initialize a variable to store the sum of even numbers.
# - Use a loop to iterate from 1 to 'n'.
# - Check if each number is even and add it to the sum.
# - Return the sum of even numbers.
sum_even_numbers <- function(n) {
    # Your code here
    sum<-0
    for (i in 1:n){
        if(i%%2==0){sum=sum+i}
    }
    return(sum)
}

# Task 2: Calculate Factorial Using a Loop
# - Define a function called 'factorial_using_loop' that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer 'n'.
# - Initialize a variable to store the factorial and set it to 1.
# - Use a loop to multiply the current number by the factorial.
# - Return the factorial.
factorial_using_loop <- function(n) {
    fact<-1
    while(n>1){
        fact<-fact*n
        n<-n-1
    }
    return(fact)
    # Your code here
}

# Task 3: Reverse a String
# - Define a function called 'reverse_string' that reverses a given string.
# - Initialize an empty string to store the reversed result.
# - Use a loop to reverse the characters in the string.
# - Return the reversed string.
reverse_string <- function(input_string) {
    # Your code here
}

# Task 4: Count the Number of Vowels
# - Define a function called 'count_vowels' that counts the number of vowels in a string.
# - Convert the input string to lowercase for case-insensitivity.
# - Initialize a variable to count the vowels.
# - Use a loop to iterate through each character and check if it's a vowel.
# - Increment the vowel count and return it.
count_vowels <- function(input_string) {
    # Your code here
}

# Task 5: Generate a Fibonacci Sequence
# - Define a function called 'generate_fibonacci' that generates the first 'n' terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
# - Initialize a vector to store the Fibonacci sequence with the first two values (1, 1).
# - Use a loop to generate the subsequent Fibonacci numbers and add them to the vector.
# - Return the first 'n' terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
generate_fibonacci <- function(n) {
    # Your code here
}
